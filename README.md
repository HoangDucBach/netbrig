## Introduction

**NetBright** is a decentralized platform designed to help students access scholarship opportunities from universities and companies. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, we aim to streamline the scholarship application and disbursement process, making it easier for students to receive financial support and for institutions to track and distribute scholarships efficiently.

### Why Request Network?

NetBright utilizes Request Network as a core component to enhance the payment and disbursement processes for scholarships. Here’s why Request Network is the ideal choice:

**1. Transparency:**  
Request Network ensures that every financial transaction, including scholarship disbursements, is visible on the blockchain. This enhances trust between students, universities, and companies.

**2. Automation with Smart Contracts:**  
By integrating Request Network, NetBright automates the creation and processing of payment requests. Once a scholarship is awarded, the payment request triggers the issuance of the NFT and transfers the funds seamlessly to the recipient.

**3. Cost-Effectiveness:**  
Request Network reduces transaction costs compared to traditional payment systems by leveraging blockchain technology, making it a financially efficient solution for managing multiple scholarships.

**4. Global Reach:**  
The decentralized nature of Request Network enables cross-border payments without the need for intermediaries, making NetBright accessible to students, universities, and companies worldwide.

**5. Compliance and Security:**  
Request Network supports compliance with international standards for payments, ensuring that all financial operations on NetBright are secure and adhere to legal regulations.

### Product Goal

NetBright aims to build a decentralized platform that connects students with scholarship opportunities from universities and companies. By leveraging blockchain technology and NFTs, we streamline the application process. Additionally, we use Request Network’s transparent payment protocol to automate the creation and disbursement of scholarships. The platform empowers talented students with easy access to financial aid and additional learning resources, while allowing universities and companies to distribute scholarships efficiently and measure their impact.
